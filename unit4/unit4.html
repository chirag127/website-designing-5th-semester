    <!-- Javascript Types -->
    <h2>Javascript Types</h2>

    <p>JavaScript has 2 types of variables:

        Primitive Data Types
        Non-Primitive Data Types
        Primitive Data Types
        Primitive Data Types in JavaScript are:

        String
        Number
        Boolean
        Null
        Undefined
        Non-Primitive Data Types
        Non-Primitive Data Types in JavaScript are:

        Object
        Array
        Function
        Date
        RegExp</p>

    <!-- Variables in JS -->
    <h2>Variables in JS</h2>

    <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.

        In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

        var x = 5;
        var y = 6;
        var z = x + y;
        JavaScript uses the keyword var to declare variables.

        The equal sign is used to assign values to variables.</p>

    <!-- Operators in JS -->
    <h2>Operators in JS</h2>

    <p>JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information
        about operator precedence.

        Assignment operators
        Comparison operators
        Arithmetic operators
        Bitwise operators
        Logical operators
        String operators
        Conditional (ternary) operator
        Comma operator
        Unary operators
        Relational operators</p>

    <!-- Conditions Statements -->
    <h2>Conditions Statements</h2>

    <p>JavaScript supports the following conditional statements. Use these statements to specify blocks of code to be
        executed in different cases.

        Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

        Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false

        Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

        Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</p>

    <!-- Java Script Loops -->
    <h2>Java Script Loops</h2>

    <p>JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

        for - loops through a block of code a number of times

        for/in - loops through the properties of an object

        for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object

        while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

        do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</p>

    <!-- JS Popup Boxes -->
    <h2>JS Popup Boxes</h2>

    <p>JavaScript provides different types of popup boxes available to display data to the user and get input from the
        user.

        Alert Box
        Prompt Box
        Confirm Box
        Alert Box
        An alert box is used when you want to ensure that information comes through to the user.

        The alert box takes the focus away from the current window, and forces the browser to read the message in the
        box.

        The alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

        Syntax
        alert("message");
        Prompt Box
        A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.

        Syntax
        prompt("message","default");
        Confirm Box
        A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.

        Syntax
        confirm("message");</p>

    <!-- JS Events -->
    <h2>JS Events</h2>

    <p>JavaScript can be used to trigger events.

        An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

        Here are some examples of HTML events:

        An HTML web page has finished loading
        An HTML input field was changed
        An HTML button was clicked
        Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

        JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

        HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

        The

        <body> element, for example, can have an onload attribute, to execute a script when the page has finished
            loading:

            <body onload="myScript">

                JavaScript can also be used to change HTML attributes, style, and content.
    </p>

    <!-- JS Arrays -->
    <h2>JS Arrays</h2>

    <p>JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

        This example declares (creates) a variable called cars, assigns an array of three car names to it, and then
        outputs the value of the first array item (car name):

        var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];
        The result of the code above will be:

        Saab
        JavaScript arrays are zero-based: The first item has index 0, the second item has index 1, and so on.

        JavaScript arrays are objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.</p>

    <!-- Working with Arrays -->
    <h2>Working with Arrays</h2>

    <p>JavaScript arrays are zero-based: The first item has index 0, the second item has index 1, and so on.

        The length property of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).

        The length property is useful when looping through the elements of an array.

        The following example uses the length property to loop through all elements of an array, and then outputs the
        value of each array element:

        var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
        var i = 0;
        var text = "";
        for (;cars[i];) {
        text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        i++;
        }
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
        The result of the code above will be:

        Saab
        Volvo
        BMW
        JavaScript arrays are objects.

        The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.</p>

    <!-- JS Objects -->
    <h2>JS Objects</h2>

    <p>JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.

        JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

        Properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

        Methods are written as name:function pairs, separated by commas.

        The following example creates a JavaScript object with four properties and two methods:

        var person = {
        firstName:"John",
        lastName:"Doe",
        age:50,
        eyeColor:"blue",
        fullName : function() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        }
        };
        The person object has properties firstName, lastName, age, eyeColor, and fullName.

        The fullName method returns the full name of the person (firstName and lastName).

        The person object can be accessed using the object name, person.

        The fullName method can be accessed using the object name, person, followed by the method name, fullName():</p>

    <!-- JS Functions -->
    <h2>JS Functions</h2>

    <p>JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword.

        The following example creates a function that adds two numbers:

        function myFunction(a, b) {
        return a + b;
        }
        The following example calls the function, passing two arguments, 4 and 3:

        var x = myFunction(4, 3);
        The result of the code above will be:

        7
        JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword.

        A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>

    <!-- Using Java Script in Real time -->
    <h2>Using Java Script in Real time</h2>

    <!-- Validation of Forms -->
    <h2>Validation of Forms</h2>

    <p>JavaScript can be used to validate forms.

        The following example shows how to validate a form that requires the user to enter a value in a field:

        function validateForm() {
        var x = document.forms["myForm"]["fname"].value;
        if (x == "") {
        alert("Name must be filled out");
        return false;
        }
        }
        The validateForm function is called when the user clicks the Submit button.

        The function checks if the value of the input field with id="fname" is empty.

        If the value is empty, the function displays an alert box with a message, and returns false to prevent the form
        from being submitted.

        The validateForm function is called when the user clicks the Submit button.

        The function checks if the value of the input field with id="fname" is empty.

        If the value is empty, the function displays an alert box with a message, and returns false to prevent the form
        from being submitted.</p>
