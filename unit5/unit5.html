    <h2>web Hosting</h2>


    <!--
 A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that hosts websites for clients, i.e. it offers the facilities required for them to create and maintain a site and makes it accessible on the World Wide Web. Companies providing web hosting services are sometimes called web hosts.

Typically, web hosting requires the following:

one or more servers to act as the host(s) for the sites; servers may be physical or virtual
colocation for the server(s), providing physical space, electricity, and Internet connectivity;
Domain Name System configuration to define name(s) for the sites and point them to the hosting server(s);
a web server running on the host;
for each site hosted on the server:
space on the server(s) to hold the files making up the site
site-specific configuration
often, a database;
software and credentials allowing the client to access these, enabling them to create, configure, and modify the site;
email connectivity allowing the host and site to send email to the client.

    <!-- Classification
Static page hosting
The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or
a web interface. The files are usually delivered to the Web "as is" or with minimal processing. Many Internet service
providers (ISPs) offer this service free to subscribers. Individuals and organizations may also obtain web page hosting
from alternative service providers.

Free web hosting service is offered by different companies with limited services, sometimes supported by
advertisements,[needs update?] and often limited when compared to paid hosting.

Single page hosting is generally sufficient for personal web pages. Personal website hosting is typically free,
advertisement-sponsored, or inexpensive. Business website hosting often has a higher expense depending upon the size and
type of the site.

Larger hosting services
Many large companies that are not Internet service providers need to be permanently connected to the web to send email,
files, etc. to other sites. The company may use the computer as a website host to provide details of their goods and
services and facilities for online orders.[incomprehensible]

A complex site calls for a more comprehensive package that provides database support and application development
platforms (e.g. ASP.NET, ColdFusion, Java EE, Perl/Plack, PHP or Ruby on Rails). These facilities allow customers to
write or install scripts for applications like forums and content management. Web hosting packages often include a web
content management system, so the end-user does not have to worry about the more technical aspects. Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) is used for websites that wish to encrypt the transmitted data.

Types of hosting

A typical server "rack" commonly seen in colocation centres
Internet hosting services can run web servers. The scope of web hosting services varies greatly.

One's website is placed on the same server as many other sites, ranging from a few sites to hundreds of websites.
Typically, all domains may share a common pool of server resources, such as RAM and the CPU. The features available with
this type of service can be quite basic and not flexible in terms of software and updates. Resellers often sell shared
web hosting and web companies often have reseller accounts to provide hosting for clients.

Reseller web hosting
Allows clients to become web hosts themselves. Resellers could function, for individual domains, under any combination
of these listed types of hosting, depending on who they are affiliated with as a reseller. Resellers' accounts may vary
tremendously in size: they may have their own virtual dedicated server to a colocated server. Many resellers provide a
nearly identical service to their provider's shared hosting plan and provide the technical support themselves.

Virtual Dedicated Server
Also known as a Virtual Private Server (VPS), divides server resources into virtual servers, where resources can be
allocated in a way that does not directly reflect the underlying hardware. VPS will often be allocated resources based
on a one server to many VPSs relationship, however virtualisation may be done for a number of reasons, including the
ability to move a VPS container between servers. The users may have root access to their own virtual space. Customers
are sometimes responsible for patching and maintaining the server (unmanaged server) or the VPS provider may provide
server admin tasks for the customer (managed server).

Dedicated hosting service
The user gets his or her own web server and gains full control over it (user has root access for Linux/administrator
access for Windows); however, the user typically does not own the server. One type of dedicated hosting is self-managed
or unmanaged. This is usually the least expensive for dedicated plans. The user has full administrative access to the
server, which means the client is responsible for the security and maintenance of his own dedicated server.

Managed hosting service
The user gets his or her own web server but is not allowed full control over it (user is denied root access for
Linux/administrator access for Windows); however, they are allowed to manage their data via FTP or other remote
management tools. The user is disallowed full control so that the provider can guarantee quality of service by not
allowing the user to modify the server or potentially create configuration problems. The user typically does not own the
server. The server is leased to the client.

Colocation web hosting service
Similar to the dedicated web hosting service, but the user owns the colo server; the hosting company provides physical
space that the server takes up and takes care of the server. This is the most powerful and expensive type of web hosting
service. In most cases, the colocation provider may provide little to no support directly for their client's machine,
providing only the electrical, Internet access, and storage facilities for the server. In most cases for colo, the
client would have his or her own administrator visit the data center on site to do any hardware upgrades or changes.
Formerly, many colocation providers would accept any system configuration for hosting, even ones housed in desktop-style
minitower cases, but most hosts now require rack mount enclosures and standard system configurations.

Cloud hosting

content and inappropriate external links, and by adding encyclopedic content written from a neutral point of view.
(January 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
This is a new type of hosting platform that allows customers powerful, scalable and reliable hosting based on clustered
load-balanced servers and utility billing. A cloud hosted website may be more reliable than alternatives since other
computers in the cloud can compensate when a single piece of hardware goes down. Also, local power disruptions or even
natural disasters are less problematic for cloud hosted sites, as cloud hosting is decentralized. Cloud hosting also
allows providers to charge users only for resources consumed by the user, rather than a flat fee for the amount the user
expects they will use, or a fixed cost upfront hardware investment. Alternatively, the lack of centralization may give
users less control on where their data is located which could be a problem for users with data security or privacy
concerns as per GDPR guidelines. Cloud hosting users can request additional resources on-demand such as only during
periods of peak traffic, while offloading IT management to the cloud hosting service.

Clustered hosting
Having multiple servers hosting the same content for better resource utilization. Clustered servers are a perfect
solution for high-availability dedicated hosting, or creating a scalable web hosting solution. A cluster may separate
web serving from database hosting capability. (Usually web hosts use clustered hosting for their shared hosting plans,
as there are multiple benefits to the mass managing of clients).

Grid hosting

This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline
citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (October 2022) (Learn how and when to
remove this template message)
This form of distributed hosting is when a server cluster acts like a grid and is composed of multiple nodes.

Home server
A private server can be used to host one or more websites from a usually consumer-grade broadband connection. These can
be purpose-built machines or more commonly old PCs. Some ISPs block home servers by disallowing incoming requests to TCP
port 80 of the user's connection and by refusing to provide static IP addresses. A common way to attain a reliable DNS
host name is by creating an account with a dynamic DNS service. A dynamic DNS service will automatically change the IP
address that a URL points to when the IP address changes.

Some specific types of hosting provided by web host service providers:

File hosting service: hosts files, not web pages
Image hosting service
Video hosting service
Blog hosting service
Paste bin
Shopping cart software

        <!-- Registering domains -->
    <h2>Registering domains</h2>

    <p>Registering a domain name is the first step to having a website. Domain names are used to identify one or more IP
        addresses and are used to create website addresses. When registering a domain name, it is important to make sure
        the
        domain name you choose is unique and closely reflects your brand. It is also important to make sure the domain
        name
        is legally available for you to use, as many domain names are already registered. Once you have chosen a domain
        name, you can register it through a domain registrar.</p>

    <p>steps for Registering domains: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Choose a domain name that is unique and reflects your brand.</li>
        <li>Check the domain name’s availability by searching a domain registrar’s website or contact them directly to
            check
            its availability.</li>
        <li>Register the domain name through the domain registrar.</li>
        <li>Set up the name servers associated with the domain name.</li>
        <li>Verify the domain name registration.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Defining Name Servers -->
    <h2>Defining Name Servers</h2>

    <p>Name servers are used to translate domain names into IP addresses. When someone types in a domain name into their
        web
        browser, the name servers associated with the domain name are used to look up the corresponding IP address and
        direct the web browser to the right website. When registering a domain name, it is important to define the name
        servers associated with the domain name.</p>

    <p>Steps for Defining Name Servers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Choose a name server provider.</li>
        <li>Set up the name servers with the provider.</li>
        <li>Configure the name server settings.</li>
        <li>Register the name servers with your domain registrar.</li>
        <li>Verify the name server settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Using Control Panel -->
    <h2>Using Control Panel</h2>

    <p>A control panel is a web-based user interface that allows users to manage their hosting accounts, domains, and
        websites. The control panel provides users with an easy way to manage their hosting accounts, domains, and
        websites
        without having to access the command line. Common tasks such as creating databases, setting up email accounts,
        and
        uploading files can be easily done through the control panel.</p>

    <p>Steps for Using Control Panel:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Access the control panel.</li>
        <li>Create databases, set up email accounts, and upload files.</li>
        <li>Manage domain names and websites.</li>
        <li>Set up security features such as firewalls and SSL certificates.</li>
        <li>Manage hosting accounts.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Creating Emails in Cpanel -->
    <h2>Creating Emails in Cpanel</h2>

    <p>Creating and managing emails in cPanel is a simple task. cPanel provides users with an easy-to-use interface to
        manage their emails. This includes creating new email accounts, setting up auto-responders, and configuring mail
        filters. cPanel also allows users to easily access their mailboxes and manage their emails.</p>

    <p>Steps for Creating Emails in Cpanel:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Login to the cPanel.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the “Emails” section.</li>
        <li>Create new email accounts.</li>
        <li>Setup auto-responders.</li>
        <li>Configure mail filters.</li>
        <li>Access mailboxes and manage emails.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Using FTP Client -->
    <h2>Using FTP Client</h2>

    <p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a way of transferring files from one computer to another. FTP is a client-server
        protocol, which means that an FTP client is used to connect to an FTP server. An FTP client is a software
        application used to upload and download files to and from an FTP server. Common FTP clients include FileZilla,
        Cyberduck, and WinSCP.</p>

    <p>Steps for using FTP Client:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Download and install an FTP client such as FileZilla, Cyberduck, or WinSCP.</li>
        <li>Enter the FTP server details such as the host name, port, username, and password.</li>
        <li>Connect to the FTP server.</li>
        <li>Upload and download files.</li>
        <li>Manage files and folders.</li>
        <li>Disconnect from the FTP server.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Maintaining a Website -->
    <h2>Maintaining a Website</h2>

    <p>Maintaining a website is an ongoing process that involves regularly updating content, checking for errors, and
        making
        sure the website is secure. It is important to keep the website up-to-date so that users have the best
        experience
        possible. It is also important to regularly check for errors and make sure the website is secure to ensure the
        safety of users’ data.</p>
