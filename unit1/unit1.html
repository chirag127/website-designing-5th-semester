    <p>Introduction to Web Designing</p>
    <p>Web Designing is a process of creating a website. It includes information architecture, user interface, website
        structure, navigation ergonomics, website layout, colors, contrasts, fonts, images, and content. Web designing
        also includes the technical and graphical aspects of a website: how it works and how it looks. Web designing is
        a creative process and it is a part of web development. Web designing is a process of conceptualization,
        planning, modeling, and execution of electronic media delivery via Internet in the form of Markup language. Web

    <p>A web designer is a person who designs websites for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private
        network). Web designers are responsible for the design, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. The
        term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design
        of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of
        web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves
        creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
    <p>Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved
        in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the
        same. Web designers use both vector and raster graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design
        prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be
        hand-coded or generated by WYSIWYG editing software. Other tools web designers might use include mark up
        validators and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web
        accessibility guidelines. </p>
    <p>Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style,
        rather than using a wide range of typefaces or type styles. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe
        fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.</p>


    <!-- Basic principles involved in developing a web site


PRINCIPLES OF GOOD WEBSITE DESIGN
An effective website design should fulfil its intended function by conveying its particular message whilst simultaneously engaging the visitor. Several factors such as consistency, colours, typography, imagery, simplicity, and functionality contribute to good website design.

When designing a website there are many key factors that will contribute to how it is perceived. A well-designed website can help build trust and guide visitors to take action. Creating a great user experience involves making sure your website design is optimised for usability (form and aesthetics) and how easy is it to use (functionality).

Below are some guidelines that will help you when considering your next web project.

1. WEBSITE PURPOSE
Your website needs to accommodate the needs of the user. Having a simple clear intention on all pages will help the user interact with what you have to offer. What is the purpose of your website? Are you imparting practical information like a ‘How to guide’? Is it an entertainment website like sports coverage or are you selling a product to the user? There are many different purposes that websites may have but there are core purposes common to all websites;

Describing Expertise
Building Your Reputation
Generating Leads
Sales and After Care
2. SIMPLICITY
Simplicity is the best way to go when considering the user experience and the usability of your website. Below are ways to achieve simplicity through design.

Colour
Colour has the power to communicate messages and evoke emotional responses. Finding a colour palette that fits your brand will allow you to influence your customer’s behaviour towards your brand. Keep the colour selection limited to less than 5 colours. Complementary colours work very well. Pleasing colour combinations increase customer engagement and make the user feel good.

Type
Typography has an important role to play on your website. It commands attention and works as the visual interpretation of the brand voice. Typefaces should be legible and only use a maximum of 3 different fonts on the website.

Imagery
Imagery is every visual aspect used within communications. This includes still photography, illustration, video and all forms of graphics. All imagery should be expressive and capture the spirit of the company and act as the embodiment of their brand personality. Most of the initial information we consume on websites is visual and as a first impression, it is important that high-quality images are used to form an impression of professionalism and credibility in the visitors’ minds.

3. NAVIGATION
Navigation is the wayfinding system used on websites where visitors interact and find what they are looking for. Website navigation is key to retaining visitors. If the website navigation is confusing visitors will give up and find what they need elsewhere. Keeping navigation simple, intuitive and consistent on every page is key.

4. F-SHAPED PATTERN READING
The F- based pattern is the most common way visitors scan text on a website. Eye-tracking studies have found that most of what people see is in the top and left areas of the screen. The F shaped layout mimics our natural pattern of reading in the West (left to right and top to bottom). An effectively designed website will work with a reader’s natural pattern of scanning the page.

5. VISUAL HIERARCHY
Visual hierarchy is the arrangement of elements in order of importance. This is done either by size, colour, imagery, contrast, typography, whitespace, texture and style. One of the most important functions of visual hierarchy is to establish a focal point; this shows visitors where the most important information is.

6. CONTENT
An effective website has both great design and great content. Using compelling language great content can attract and influence visitors by converting them into customers.

7. GRID BASED LAYOUT
Grids help to structure your design and keep your content organised. The grid helps to align elements on the page and keep it clean. The grid-based layout arranges content into a clean rigid grid structure with columns, sections that line up and feel balanced and impose order and results in an aesthetically pleasing website.

Importance of load time by Feelingpeaky Ltd
8. LOAD TIME
Waiting for a website to load will lose visitors. Nearly half of web visitors expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less and they will potentially leave a site that isn’t loaded within 3 seconds. Optimising image sizes will help load your site faster.

9. MOBILE FRIENDLY
More people are using their phones or other devices to browse the web. It is important to consider building your website with a responsive layout where your website can adjust to different screens.

1. Purpose
Good web design always caters to the needs of the user. Are your web visitors looking for information, entertainment, some type of interaction, or to transact with your business? Each page of your website needs to have a clear purpose, and to fulfill a specific need for your website users in the most effective way possible.

2. Communication
People on the web tend to want information quickly, so it is important to communicate clearly, and make your information easy to read and digest. Some effective tactics to include in your web design include: organising information using headlines and sub headlines, using bullet points instead of long windy sentences, and cutting the waffle.

3. Typefaces
In general, Sans Serif fonts such as Arial and Verdana are easier to read online (Sans Serif fonts are contemporary looking fonts without decorative finishes). The ideal font size for reading easily online is 16px and stick to a maximum of 3 typefaces in a maximum of 3 point sizes to keep your design streamlined. Principles of effective web design_Serif vs Sans Serif Typography

4. Colours
A well thought out colour palette can go a long way to enhance the user experience. Complementary colours create balance and harmony. Using contrasting colours for the text and background will make reading easier on the eye. Vibrant colours create emotion and should be used sparingly (e.g. for buttons and call to actions). Last but not least, white space/ negative space is very effective at giving your website a modern and uncluttered look.

5. Images
A picture can speak a thousand words, and choosing the right images for your website can help with brand positioning and connecting with your target audience. If you don’t have high quality professional photos on hand, consider purchasing stock photos to lift the look of your website. Also consider using infographics, videos and graphics as these can be much more effective at communicating than even the most well written piece of text.

6. Navigation
Navigation is about how easy it is for people to take action and move around your website. Some tactics for effective navigation include a logical page hierarchy, using bread crumbs, designing clickable buttons, and following the ‘three click rule’ which means users will be able to find the information they are looking for within three clicks.

7. Grid based layouts
Placing content randomly on your web page can end up with a haphazard appearance that is messy. Grid based layouts arrange content into sections, columns and boxes that line up and feel balanced, which leads to a better looking website design.

8. “F” Pattern design
Eye tracking studies have identified that people scan computer screens in an “F” pattern. Most of what people see is in the top and left of the screen and the right side of the screen is rarely seen. Rather than trying to force the viewer’s visual flow, effectively designed websites will work with a reader’s natural behaviour and display information in order of importance (left to right, and top to bottom). Principles of effective web design_F Layout

9. Load time
Everybody hates a website that takes ages to load.  Tips to make page load times more effective include optimising image sizes (size and scale), combining code into a central CSS or JavaScript file (this reduces HTTP requests) and minify HTML, CSS, JavaScript (compressed to speed up their load time).

10: Mobile friendly
It is now commonplace to access websites from multiple devices with multiple screen sizes, so it is important to consider if your website is mobile friendly. If your website is not mobile friendly, you can either rebuild it in a responsive layout (this means your website will adjust to different screen widths) or you can build a dedicated mobile site (a separate website optimised specifically for mobile users). Mobile Friendly Web Design It is easy to create a beautiful and functional website, simply by keeping these design elements in mind. Have you got a website design that needs reviewing or optimising? Or perhaps, you are planning a website and you are looking to get the design right from the ground up. Either way, these principles of effective web design can help your website be more engaging, useful, and memorable for visitors.-->

        <!-- Planning process -->

        <h2>Planning process</h2>
        <!--
Before launching a website, the planning process is vital to ensuring everything goes smoothly down the road. In this
day and age, there are so many sites out there on the internet. It is almost impossible for a business to do well
without having a website that works well for both the company and its clients. Interestingly enough, there is a lot to
be done before the coding of a website takes place. There are many steps which need to be followed for it to be properly
developed. The purpose of development planning is to make sure nothing is forgotten.

There are seven steps that should be followed from start to finish when developing a website.

Research and goal setting

Planning

Designing the layout

Writing the content

Coding

Testing and launching

Maintaining

The last step involves updating and doing maintenance on the website often, even after it has been launched to ensure it
is still working properly. An effective website means that visitors will be more likely to become loyal customers.

Planning a website can take a lot of time and effort. It can also cost money to launch a website. The two most important
factors that need to be taken into consideration are time and money. During the planning process, it is a good idea to
make a timeline or have a goal of how long you might need to spend on each step. The more time that is taken during the
first few steps of planning, the less you will have to do in the long run.


Website Development Planning Process


Website Development Planning Process

1. RESEARCH AND GOAL SETTING
As with any project, it is important to do proper research and set goals before beginning. By setting goals, it will
help the website to have a direction and will also help your business to achieve specific accomplishments. The planning
and goal setting process could take about 1-2 weeks to complete. It is a very important first step to creating a website
that sells. There are a few questions you should ask yourself during this phase:

What do I hope for my website to accomplish?

Who is the audience I would like to target?

What are the main goals of the website?

By setting goals for your website, you will be helping the site to have a clear direction and purpose. This is important
to the rest of the steps. When setting your goals, you should think about outlining what you would like the rest of the
steps to look like. Step 1 will guide you through the rest of the process smoothly.

The research part of this step has a few different purposes. There are so many examples out there that it might be
beneficial for you to look at and use some of the websites of your competitors. This can help you to determine what you
want and don’t want your website to have. It is also important to do some research on the target audience you hope to
draw in.

Different age groups may be looking for something different when they visit a website. Understanding what your audience
wants is crucial to planning the rest of your website. It is also important to research keywords you’d like to use with
your website. By developing your website with SEO in mind, you will save yourself a lot of work in the future.


2. PLANNING THE SITE
Planning the website involves creating a wireframe and sitemap. This is an important step because it is kind of like the
skeleton of your site. This process can take about 2-6 weeks to complete. The sitemap allows the developer to get an
outline of what the site will look like, what pages there will be and how they will interact with each other. This not
only helps with planning but is also beneficial to the user experience.

A user should be able to easily navigate a site, and this begins with the development of the sitemap. Before you begin
to plan content, a sitemap lets you design what the structure will look like. Once the sitemap is completed, the other
part of this step is to create a wireframe or mock-up. These are just visual representations of what the site will look
like. This does not include the layout details. That comes next.


3. DESIGNING THE LAYOUT
The details of the layout are what will give your website character. This is the step where you get to be creative with
pictures, videos and what kinds of things the customer will notice when they come to your site. This process can take
about 4-12 weeks from start to finish. The timing depends on experience, time spent on the project, and how thorough the
developer is. During this step, it is especially important to keep referring back to the target audience you wish to
focus on.

Consider colors, logos, and anything that will encourage your audience to interact with the site. By considering how you
will create the layout of the website, you are attempting to bring the website to life. It should help the audience to
get a feel for your business or product. Please note this step does not yet involve written content. That is the next
step. The written content is so important that it needs its own step.


4. WRITING THE CONTENT
This step may be going on simultaneously with the other development planning steps. The written content of a website is
so important to its success. While this step may be happening during other steps, it is one that is crucial and deserves
a lot of expertise. It could take from 5 to 15 weeks. The written content on a website is going to help a visitor
determine their next steps. It is vital to drawing customers in and keeping them. There is a lot to consider when
working on the content of the website.

When determining what words to use, it is important that they are not too hard to understand. A general rule is that you
have to assume not everyone is going to want to read words that are higher vocabulary. A website should have a
vocabulary that the average person can understand.

Again, considering the target audience is extremely important, especially when it comes to the text being used to give
customers information. This can determine what kinds of words and voice will be used in the writing, which can create
the mood for the content, whether it be good or bad. It also involves creating catchy titles and headlines to draw
people in.

Additionally, it is also a good idea to be well-versed in writing a call-to-action. This is what you want the user to do
after reading the content on the site. The content should get customers excited about buying a product or service. A
website that has well-written content is going to be much more successful than ones that do not.


5. CODING THE WEBSITE
Now that all aspects of your website have been created, you are ready to actually begin creating the website itself. The
coding typically begins with the homepage and gradually branches out to the other pages included in the site. This would
be where the sitemap is followed to ensure everything is coded correctly. The coding step could take from 6 to 15 weeks,
depending on how much content and how intricate you would like your website to be. It is also important to set up
frameworks and CMS to make sure that everything will fit onto the server during the installation process. You wouldn’t
want to do all that work only to find out it doesn’t fit.

Once the website is laid out according to the sitemap, it should be tested before moving any further. If all works well,
then the rest of the content should be added, and formatting should be completed. This phase involves having a deep
understanding of the technology you are using. In fact, if you are looking to do most of the work yourself, you should
at least consider getting a developer to code for you, so that you can make sure everything works as planned.

During coding, don’t forget to consider factors such as SEO, CMS plugins, and any additional tools you might be using
for analyzing and testing the website in the future. If you consider these things now, you will save yourself time and
energy later. By keeping SEO in mind, you will get better results, and more people will be exposed to your page.
Anything worth doing is worth doing right.


6. TESTING AND LAUNCHING
Before the website is launched, it is crucial that it is tested out by real users. All the links and content should be
tested to see if it works. Not only is it important to test out all the buttons and everything on the site, but it is
also important to test out what users think of it. There is user testing that can be completed to make sure the website
is giving users what they need to be successful on the test.

Again, there are tools that can be used to determine if anything needs to be changed. Make sure to check all written
content, including spelling and grammar. If your website has forms, ensure that they are working correctly as well.
These might be important ways the users can get in touch with you or sign up for alerts and messages. Without these
working properly, it can be very difficult for the user and also will be difficult for you to have a successful website.


Don’t just check the website once, but check it over multiple times. When you are confident that everything is in
working order, you can go ahead and launch your website live. When it comes to launching, you are finally ready and can
do this by uploading it to the server. You will need FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for this process. It is also important
to make sure everything is running smoothly immediately after launching. Testing and launching may take 2-4 weeks to
complete.


7. MAINTENANCE
You might think your job is done once the website is launched, but this is not the case. Since technology and products
are changing more rapidly than ever before, it is important to stay up-to-date with what is happening on the internet.
Maintaining a website is hard work, but the more effort put into its maintenance, the better. There are a few different
pieces to website upkeep.

For one, it should constantly be checked out for errors. When a user encounters an error, this may be frustrating and
may cause them to find what they are looking for somewhere else. Errors can also completely block them from the
information they need to make a decision on purchasing a product or service. This is why it is important to not only
test your website for user experience before the launch, but after as well.

User-experience should be tested often, and it should be ongoing. This will ensure that if something comes up, it can be
fixed right away. A website that has constant broken links or outdated content will not make its users happy. By having
regular maintenance on a website, bugs can be fixed as soon as they are detected. A problem cannot be fixed if it is not
known. An unhappy user means that you are losing current or potential customers.

Another important aspect of maintaining a website is to ensure that all content is current. This means that the correct
information is on the website such as contact information, pricing, and customer reviews. By giving bad or outdated
information, a customer will not be able to get in touch with the business owner, complete a purchase, and it can be
frustrating.

While maintaining a website can be important, it might seem like hard work. It is important to know that there are many
tools out there that can be downloaded right onto the website. Reports can be sent daily or in other time increments to
give you data and information about how the site is performing.


DO I NEED TO HIRE A PROFESSIONAL?
There are a couple of things to consider when thinking about hiring a professional to help. The main factors to consider
when figuring out if you should hire someone to assist you are time, money, and experience. Depending on the experience
you have with the building of websites, you might consider hiring a professional to help you through the whole process
or for just a couple of the steps.

If you are ambitious and have time to learn something new, then perhaps this is a great opportunity. It is also
important to be aware that there are many online tools that can help you during the development phase. There are also
many online tools that can be used to help maintain and update your website as well.

You also have to take into consideration the time it takes to build a good website. Chances are, if you would like to
get your website up and running as quickly and as effectively as possible, you might want to consider hiring something.
If you have a lot of time and a lower budget, then doing the work yourself is possible. Building a website is a long
process and may take some time, so if you have the time to spend on it, go ahead and do it yourself. Be sure to do your
research beforehand about what it takes to build a website and the different options you have.

Another factor to consider is your budget. If you have a budget that allows for hiring a professional, this could free
up your time to be spending on other aspects of your business. You also want to make sure that the money you spend on
your website is going to be worth it and help your business to become more profitable. Take the time to consider whether
or not hiring someone is right for you.


FINAL WORDS
Now you know the steps it takes to begin developing your website. This can be a lengthy, but very rewarding process. By
following these steps, you can ensure that the website you launch does its job, which is to help your business be
successful. It is also important to keep in mind that once your website is launched, your job is not done. Maintaining a
website is an ongoing and important step that will help your customers to be happy and keep coming back. Remember to
take your time during these steps and get your website created properly the first time. By following the steps above, it
will save you lots of time and frustration in the future. -->

<h2>
            Domains and Hosting
        </h2>
        <p>A domain name refers to the URL people type in a web browser’s address bar to access your site. In other words, domain names offer a convenient way for people to access websites.

Without it, they would have to use a numerical label assigned to every website and server on the internet, also known as an IP address.

Generally, domain names are comprised of two main parts – a second-level domain (SLD) and a top-level domain (TLD). Second-level domains usually consist of words or phrases, while top-level domains are the predetermined extensions that follow.

For example, in the case of google.com, the second-level domain is google, and .com is the TLD. To learn more about domain names and how they work, read our beginner-friendly guide.

To get a domain name for your website, you need to register it first. Domain registration is the process of reserving a name on the internet for a certain period. Usually, you need to renew the license once per year, but you can pay up in advance for up to 10 years for the domain to be registered under your name.

Companies or organizations that sell and manage domain name registrations are called domain registrars. Domain registrars are listed under ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), an authority that coordinates and manages domain databases on the internet.</p>

        <h2>
            Hosting
        </h2>
        <p>Hosting is the process of storing your website’s files on a server. The server is a computer that is connected to the internet and is accessible to anyone who wants to access your website.

There are two types of hosting: free and paid. Free hosting is usually limited in terms of features and functionality, and it’s not recommended for serious websites. Paid hosting, on the other hand, is more reliable and offers more features.

There are many hosting providers out there, and choosing the right one can be a daunting task. To help you make the right decision, we’ve put together a list of the best web hosting services for small businesses.

<!-- Responsive Web Designing-->

<h2>Responsive Web Designing</h2>
        <p>Responsive web design is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).

Responsive web design is focused primarily on providing an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).

Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media.

Flexible layouts do not advocate the use of fixed measurement units, such as pixels or inches, but rather relative measurement units, such as percentages, ems, or rems. This allows the page to dynamically resize to any width of the viewing device while maintaining the content’s legibility and functionality.

Media queries are a new CSS3 module that allows the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on, most commonly the width of the browser.

Flexible media are media that change size as the size of the viewport changes. Images, videos, and other media types can be made to be responsive by adjusting their width to be 100% of the parent element.

        </p>

        <!-- Web Designing -->

        <h2>Web Designing</h2>
        <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.

The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

        <!-- Types of websites -->

        <h2>Types of websites</h2>

        <p>There are many different types of websites, and each type has its own purpose. The most common types of websites are:</p>

        <dl class="dl-horizontal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.5; color: #212529; text-align: left; background-color: transparent; border: 0px; border-radius: 0px; padding: 0px; width: 100%; list-style-type: circle;">
            <dt>Static Website</dt>

            <dd>

                A static website is a website that is coded in HTML. This means that the website is not dynamic, and it

                cannot be changed. This type of website is usually used for informational purposes only.


            </dd>

            <dt>Dynamic Website</dt>

            <dd>

                A website, or individual web page, can be static or dynamic. A static website or static web page contains information that doesn't change automatically. It remains the same, or static, for every viewer of the site. A dynamic website or dynamic web page contains information that changes, depending on the viewer, the time of the day, the time zone, the viewer's native language, and other factors. For example, the Computer Hope home page is a dynamic web page that automatically changes daily to give visitors new content. However, this page you're reading now is a static page that remains the same until it is updated.

<!-- Web Standards -->

<h2>
    Web Standards
</h2>

<p>
Web standards are the technologies we use to build web sites. These standards exist as long technical documents called specifications, which detail exactly how the technology should work. These documents are not very useful for learning how to use the technologies they describe (this is why we have sites like MDN Web Docs), but instead are intended to be used by software engineers to implement these technologies (usually in web browsers).
<br>
For example, the HTML Living Standard describes exactly how HTML (all the HTML elements, and their associated APIs, and other surrounding technologies) should be implemented.
<br>
Web standards are created by standards bodies — institutions that invite groups of people from different technology companies to come together and agree on how the technologies should work in the best way to fulfill all of their use cases. The W3C is the best known web standards body, but there are others such as the WHATWG (who maintain the living standards for the HTML language), ECMA (who publish the standard for ECMAScript, which JavaScript is based on), Khronos (who publish technologies for 3D graphics, such as WebGL), and others.

<h2>
    Creating an HTML document

</h2>

<p>
    To create an HTML document, you must create a text file with a ".html" extension. The text file should contain HTML tags. The HTML tags tell the browser how to display the content.
    <br>

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    </body>
    </html>

</p>

<!-- Mark up Tags -->

<h2>
    Mark up Tags

</h2>

<p>
    HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets. Like this: <tagname>. An HTML tag usually consists of a "start tag" and an "end tag", with the content inserted in between. The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name. Like this: </tagname>.
    <br>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</p>


<!-- Line Breaks -->

<h2>
    Line Breaks

</h2>

<p>
    HTML documents are displayed in a browser window. If a browser window is too small to hold a document, a horizontal scrollbar appears at the bottom of the window. To create a line break, use the <br> tag. Like this:
    <br>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.<br>This is another paragraph.</p>

</p>

</body>

</html>
